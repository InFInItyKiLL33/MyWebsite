A backup was restored by them but the owners decided it was best to rebuild the site as the one and only backup was partially corrupted. They hired me again to help restore the website, using Wordpress once again. It was a lengthy process but it was fully completed in about 2 to 3 weeks. \n
            The hardest part about the process was to keep the use of custom CSS/Javascript to a minimum. With this restriction, I managed to learn how to rebuild it to how it was before without the use of Javascript. Although the challenge was not required by them, it was a good opportunity to challenge my skills. Not only that, I felt that it was better to do so as the interns they hired were generally new to programming, and it would make their life easier to edit by keeping it simpler.`

            \n
            In summary, we managed to convince them to have a website built, but due to their lack of and delayed responses, and that it was mostly a one-way communication, we decided to drop this project with them.
            \n
            It was quite disheartening as I managed to design almost every page of the website, and was about 75% of the way done coding. However, we failed to account that in trying to keep the project efficient in terms of time, we didn't sign a contract or discuss in detail the pay or the final design. Although I did send them a copy of the designs, they took weeks to reply and when they said it was not fully what they wanted, nor were they interested in paying what we expected.

I was recommended and join them as an intern for 4 Months, before my enlistment into the Army. This was a good opportunity for me to learn how to use a website building app, Wordpress in this case, instead of only knowing how to create websites with pure HTML/CSS/JS with jQuery.
            \n
            Through this internship, I realised how much easier and restrictive website building apps are, as they make elements super easy to create through the drag and drop experience. However, the ability to customise the styles and elements is quite limited, unless I decide to inject custom code into it. Most of the website was luckily, already done by the previous intern, which only gave me the chance to design and create a few pages (specifically the Get Involved page, picture beside, which does not show hover effects).

            I would have definitely continued the internship with how heartwarming and welcome the management was, if it wasn't for the conscription into the Army in April. This would, however, not be the end of working with them as they hired me as a freelancer the next year.

It felt a bit heartbreaking as I wasted so much time trying to set it up on AWS but in the end, they had to host an older build locally, meaning there were bugs.

            The project was to create an online website for a Salon Shop that stored the database for all the transactions and users and we had to display it for the staff. We had to include not only the basic information, but also implement user tiers based on their subscription.
            \n
            Overall, I probably took the most time out of everyone in the class to finish the project as the design and backend were all functional with animations like bootstrap. It was quite worth it as we were considered unfair to the competition with other groups that we were placed under Special Mention. Fun fact, although the requirement was to submit a wireframe of the design, only my group did as everyone else just had a barebones HTML page without much or even any desingn.`

Since I was still quite a novice at programming, I decided to just use my basic HTML, CSS and JS knowledge with jQuery to make out a web application.

            It didn't help that I had a group of 5, but of which 3 had zero clue on programming and just did their own things throughout the course.

            The app featured an initial searchbar like Google's home page, and was used to search for stocks, currencies and cryptocurrencies. The searchbar scaled dynamically, and the charts were actually functional, with hover effects to see the price and time at that point on the cursor, with a crosshair. It was acutally quite a accomplishment to finish all of that in one day.

            Although I didn't win anything at the end of the day, I was proud of what I have done, given the handicap on both manpower and time. From this event, I actually learnt not only how to host things on AWS, I learned how to use APIs as well.`

            I was not wrong in being able to understand some parts of web development, but I was very lacking in the backend. As such, all the progress made were just static sites that although could fetch data with API on the planner, it was as far as I got. This was also the time I learned jQuery and regret on how much I missed out during Google CSSI course.

            I then took a few weeks break to focus on my studies with some flying here and there. However, it kept breaking as the API I used kept updating it's JSON format and after fixing it many times, I just stopped using it as it was getting very inconvenient to fix it.

            Our end goal was to create any web application with what we have learnt and although my team of 3, only 2 of us knew how to code which meant there was a lack of manpower.

The picture shown is just a screenshot of the static page, but the actual site when executed with Python works normally.

            This project might seem pointless, but it was used to track my mastery score that I achieved at the end of each game.

            This was just to understand how good I was at a champion but it got a little pointless after League updated their user profiles over time. Not only that, I slowly lost interest in the game and ultimately stopped playing it, which meant the lack of meaning to maintain the app.

            The mastery tab showed the overview of each champion, and you can scroll down to see all the data. The ranked tab was never developed but it was supposed to show add additional data of each ranked match in addition to the normal mastery. The Add New tab was just to add a new entry of the most recent game or edit champion level.

Imagine if I actually developed this and sold it.

            Anyways, with just three pages of UI, there were nearly 2000 lines of code and it was lagging whenever I tried editing it. Mostly, it came down to not knowing loops existed so I had to copy and paste code many times. I eventually gave up when I realised that X-Plane's plugins do not support Python and had to be coded in C if I correct. It did not however, stop my programming career surprisingly.`
