            The purpose of this bot was to not only make the 2nd of three bot more reliable, it also could let me know if any of my computers shut down randomly. Basically, each computer will run this bot simultaneously and talk to each other on the network every so often. If it detects that a computer is unresponsive, it will ask other computers on whether it was actually down or just that connection was faulty. Not only that, it will ping it at least one more time to double confirm it is down. After that, it will inform me on discord that a connection was lost and since I had remote control of the computer's power plug, I can just force a restart of the computer as they were setup to automatically turn on when they receive power.
            \n
            As useful as this may seem, it was only relevant for a few months as mining ended when Ethereum switch to Proof of Work in September 2022, and so ever since that period, this bot has basically been decomissioned.

            The goal of this bot was to set personal reminders on discord in the future at a specific date and time. As much as I could have used Google Calendar, it just felt very tedious to set it up when I can just type one line of command to set a reminder. It also served as a multi function bot that informed me about prices of markets that I watched, as well as personal balances from my mining outcome using APIs. Not only that, I could use it as a to-do list as well, showing the versitility of this bot.
            \n
            The only time this bot was unreliable was of how often my computers like to shut down randomly due to my mining rigs. If the bot was hosted on the computer that shut down, the bot will go down along with it, and I wouldn't know that it did until a long time later when I realise why I'm missing my reminders.
            \n
            At the end of the day, after the whole mining fiesta in September 2022, I just converted one of my computers to host this bot as it's sole purpose as it's still useful for me.

            \n
            This first bot had three subgoals really. The first was to get myself the lastest and extremely good value GPU at the market price - the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 10GB. Due to the value of this GPU at it's pricepoint, it was extremely saught after by gamers and miners alike. As I was both, it was of great use to me to try and get at least one for myself. At the end of the day, although it managed to inform me multiple times that different products of the RTX 3000 series, none of which was the 3080 10GB variant. However, it did allow me to still get some of them for my friends that also wanted the latest GPUs, and I helped them to get it at market price. It also however, did make me miss quite a few products as it was somehow extremely inconsistent with purchasing by itself even after fixing it many times, which was quite a missed opportunity as I would not have mind some of those parts over the RTX 3080 as well. At the end of the day, how I got my 3080 was through a manual search one day by myself instead of relying on the bot.
            \n

            \n
            In summary, we managed to convince them to have a website built, but due to their lack of and delayed responses, and that it was mostly a one-way communication, we decided to drop this project with them.
            \n
            It was quite disheartening as I managed to design almost every page of the website, and was about 75% of the way done coding. However, we failed to account that in trying to keep the project efficient in terms of time, we didn't sign a contract or discuss in detail the pay or the final design.

            Through this internship, I realised how much easier and restrictive website building apps are, as they make elements super easy to create through the drag and drop experience. However, the ability to customise the styles and elements is quite limited, unless I decide to inject custom code into it. Most of the website was luckily, already done by the previous intern, which only gave me the chance to design and create a few pages (specifically the Get Involved page, picture beside, which does not show hover effects).

The event was held over three weeks, with the first half in SUTD, and the second half in Google's own HQ in Singapore. It was an amazing experience as they treated us like Googlers, allowing us to eat their amazing free buffet every day and explore the entire office. They even loaned us Macbooks to bring back home for the entire course!
            \n
            This was the course that kickstarted my journey in web development. Prior to this, the only language I really knew was Python. This course taught me all the basics for HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Python as well with Flask backend but I've already learnt it). jQuery was taught as well but I didn't attend the course due to other competitions on that day. Fun fact, during the Python lesson, I made a full on Minesweeper recreation with Python and tkinter in under 2 hours.
            \n
            Our end goal was to create any web application with what we have learnt and although my team of 3, only 2 of us knew how to code which meant there was a lack of manpower. On top of that, the person who knew how to code only basically know jQuery. From there, I had to design everything and code out just about all the elements with it's backend, less animations. The picture shown is just a screenshot of the static page, but the actual site when executed with Python works normally. It's basically a Truth of Dare generator for people who want to play Truth or Dare. It will rotate among the players and during each player's turn, their name will be displayed and they can select either option to generate a truth or a dare.
            \n
            It was no surprise that my team wasn't the top few but hey, it was an extremely fun event to go for, with many things learnt, and I would love to go for it again given the opportunity to.`

This was in fact, reworked twice throughout the project timeline, with each iteration looking better than the previous one. The latest version took inspiration from the League of Legends client.
            \n
            This project might seem pointless, but it was used to track my mastery score that I achieved at the end of each game. It was not connected to any APIs (although I wanted to but Garena had poor and mostly zero support for the SEA region on League of Legends), and each data was entered manually through the UI at the end of each round, assuming I remembered to.
            \n
            This was just to understand how good I was at a champion but it got a little pointless after League updated their user profiles over time. Not only that, I slowly lost interest in the game and ultimately stopped playing it, which meant the lack of meaning to maintain the app.
            \n
            The mastery tab showed the overview of each champion, and you can scroll down to see all the data. The ranked tab was never developed but it was supposed to show add additional data of each ranked match in addition to the normal mastery. The Add New tab was just to add a new entry of the most recent game or edit champion level.
            \n

            This app was made as I was flying flight simulators at that time, and there was a plugin called Chase Plane for a different flight simulator called Prepar3d. However, I was using X-Plane 11 at that time and there were no plugins that could do cinematic views. In fact, I don't think any exists as of writing this right now either. Imagine if I actually developed this and sold it.
            \n
            Anyways, with just three pages of UI, there were nearly 2000 lines of code and it was lagging whenever I tried editing it. Mostly, it came down to not knowing loops existed so I had to copy and paste code many times. I eventually gave up when I realised that X-Plane's plugins do not support Python and had to be coded in C if I correct. It did not however, stop my programming career surprisingly.`

The major one being visuals and it was nowhere close to any of the existing simulators. I purchased it when it came out and was surprised at how well it performed. However, the only lacking part is the physics department as X-Plane still handles it better even when X-Plane 12 got released in 2022. For me, it was more stable to run MSFS than X-Plane 11 and so I switched over. Besides, the visuals were too good to pass over.

            Although I did go back to X-Plane to fly the 787 a few times, I usually still fly on MSFS with the B777-300ER, A330-900, A320neo and B737-600 as it felt more realistic. Eventually I just settled into MSFS and used it as my main simulator. By the end of 2022, roughly 100 flights were done on MSFS, which although wasn't much in three years, most were done in 2020 and 2022 where I had more time out of National Service.

BOE1 was supposed to fly from Boeing's factory at Everett (KPAE) to Singapore. However, not long after it's takeoff from KPAE, it diverted back to it's origin as Boeing pulled out last minute.

            `My time in SYFC went from it's high to it's low very quickly. I was considered one of, or if not the best student in the class (BFC 243). However, my time was cut short after the 8th flying lesson.
            \n
            At the start, during the theory part, we were tasked to remember the entire checklist from start to end. They had a grading from 1 - 7, where a 4 is required to pass, and getting a 4-5 was the norm. As for getting a 1 and 7, those basially never happen unless you were as smooth as someone who had thousands of flight hours or didn't know a single item on the checklist. Somehow or rather, I was the only one in the class who got a 6 for two different checklist test (one normal, one emergency). In addition, during my normal simulator and actual flying lessons, my average score was a 5. In fact, my instructor believed in my abilities so much so that he recommended me for the Private Pilot License (PPL) stage around the 3rd - 4th flying lesson, whereas the usual was at least 8 - 10 lessons. 
            \n
            To explain the system further, it's split into three parts: BFC1, BFC2 and PPL stage, where BFC1 is lesson 1 - 6, BFC2 is lessons 7 - 16 (where 16 is your first solo flight), and PPL is lesson 17 to around 52 where you get an actual PPL. 
            \n
            To get into BFC1, you need to pass their initial interview to join SYFC, and their medical checkup, which is Class 2 Aviation Medical Certificate. 
            \n
            BFC2 is usually a breeze for most to enter as long as you were an acceptable pilot. 
            \n
            PPL stage is only for the elite few, requiring you to be recommended by your instructor, and pass all additional Medical Requirements and COMPASS Test by the Air Force (it's the exact same requirement as joining the Air Force, which is stricter than Class 1 Aviation Medical Certificate). Out of a class of 30 or so in BFC1, usually only 1-3 pax will survive until the PPL stage. Many of whom aren't recommended, and some of which fail the medical requirements/COMPASS.
            \n
            As for myself, I failed the medical requirements for PPL course, and I since I did the tests early due to my instructor's recommendation, I was immediately withdrawn from SYFC right as my results came out and I didn't even get to fly my first solo. It was a heartbreaking moment but made me realised that although I didn't meet Air Force requirements, I still have a chance in the future to get a PPL, or even other licenses like ATPL if I can pass the Medical Assessmnt Class 1 and join airlines. It was also a fun time getting a total of 9.0 flight hours on the DA40 NG.`

I stayed there for about 50 controlling hours until I took a test for S2 as a Tower (TWR) controller. I managed to pass it the first time without much issues and I stayed at S2 for the rest of my time as a controller. Most of the time, I was controlling either Jakarta Airport or Bali Airport.

            As much as I wanted to continue to be a controller, most of the time the airports were empty without anyone there, with the only busy time during my S2 test and a World Flight event. As such, I just stopped coming online as a controller, but I still use VATSIM as a pilot from time to time.

            As a young teenager, this was an expensive investment that paved my interest in aviation until the present. Previously, I was playing some random flight simulators on the web. Due to how unrealistic it was, I thought perhaps I should invest in an actual simulator. It was a good time for me to come into flight simulation as X-Plane 11 was just recently announced and the beta was released here. I bought it and was also given X-Plane 10 for free. I didn't really touch X-Plane 10 at all but X-Plane 11 was my main simulator until Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) came out in 2020. In fact, even by the end of 2022, around 80% of my lifetime flights was done in X-Plane 11.
            \n
            I started off with Mouse and Keyboard for flight sim, but eventually went for a Logitech Extreme 3D Joystick. After that, it was upgraded to a Thrustmaster T16000M, Logitech G Pro Throttle, and Thrustmaster TFRP. It stayed as such for many years to come as flight sim as a hobby and it's peripherals are generally very expensive.
            \n
            In X-Plane 11, most of my flights were of the B777-300ER, but there were quite a bit on the B737-800, A320-214, B787-9 and DA40 NG. Aside from the DA40 being used to practice at the time in Singapore Youth Flying Club, the other planes were used not only on my regular flights, but also to participate in events like Cross the Pond, and to make some YouTube videos with it, especially tutorials on how to fly or modify the aircraft to make it more realistic.

This was because their response rate was at least 2 weeks when we wanted to get a feedback on our work. Eventually it got so bad that we decided to just drop the project as it seemed as if they lacked interest in our work. Although the design felt a little bubbly or inmature by my standards, I wasn't fully motivated as well at the time as their estimated pay for the freelance project felt quite low.`

For the progamming stories, you can go to the programmng tab to have a look, but as for the design part, I feel that it was underwhelming. It doesn't look good at all but that's because in my group of 3, only I could code and design, whilst the other two basically had nothing skillful, so they were given the job for ideation. At the end of the day, although we had like 3 days to create our app, we ended up only having one as they couldn't decide on something until nearly the end.

            This basically affected my motivation, plus I had to use a laptop I wasn't used to using, so my creativity hit rock bottom and affected all my skills.

As much as it sucked, the everything else there was balanced out by the environment we worked at.
