            \n
            The hardest part about the process was to keep the use of custom CSS/Javascript to a minimum. With this restriction, I managed to learn how to rebuild it to how it was before without the use of Javascript. Although the challenge was not required by them, it was a good opportunity to challenge my skills. Not only that, I felt that it was better to do so as the interns they hired were generally new to programming, and it would make their life easier to edit by keeping it simpler.`

            The purpose of this bot was to not only make the 2nd of three bot more reliable, it also could let me know if any of my computers shut down randomly. Basically, each computer will run this bot simultaneously and talk to each other on the network every so often. If it detects that a computer is unresponsive, it will ask other computers on whether it was actually down or just that connection was faulty. Not only that, it will ping it at least one more time to double confirm it is down. After that, it will inform me on discord that a connection was lost and since I had remote control of the computer's power plug, I can just force a restart of the computer as they were setup to automatically turn on when they receive power.
            \n
            As useful as this may seem, it was only relevant for a few months as mining ended when Ethereum switch to Proof of Work in September 2022, and so ever since that period, this bot has basically been decomissioned.

            The goal of this bot was to set personal reminders on discord in the future at a specific date and time. As much as I could have used Google Calendar, it just felt very tedious to set it up when I can just type one line of command to set a reminder. It also served as a multi function bot that informed me about prices of markets that I watched, as well as personal balances from my mining outcome using APIs. Not only that, I could use it as a to-do list as well, showing the versitility of this bot.
            \n
            The only time this bot was unreliable was of how often my computers like to shut down randomly due to my mining rigs. If the bot was hosted on the computer that shut down, the bot will go down along with it, and I wouldn't know that it did until a long time later when I realise why I'm missing my reminders.
            \n
            At the end of the day, after the whole mining fiesta in September 2022, I just converted one of my computers to host this bot as it's sole purpose as it's still useful for me. Although it may be cheaper to host it on a webserver, I feel it's much easier and fun to update it on my own computer.`

            \n
            This first bot had three subgoals really. The first was to get myself the lastest and extremely good value GPU at the market price - the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 10GB. Due to the value of this GPU at it's pricepoint, it was extremely saught after by gamers and miners alike. As I was both, it was of great use to me to try and get at least one for myself. At the end of the day, although it managed to inform me multiple times that different products of the RTX 3000 series, none of which was the 3080 10GB variant. However, it did allow me to still get some of them for my friends that also wanted the latest GPUs, and I helped them to get it at market price. It also however, did make me miss quite a few products as it was somehow extremely inconsistent with purchasing by itself even after fixing it many times, which was quite a missed opportunity as I would not have mind some of those parts over the RTX 3080 as well. At the end of the day, how I got my 3080 was through a manual search one day by myself instead of relying on the bot.
            \n

            \n
            Through this internship, I realised how much easier and restrictive website building apps are, as they make elements super easy to create through the drag and drop experience. However, the ability to customise the styles and elements is quite limited, unless I decide to inject custom code into it. Most of the website was luckily, already done by the previous intern, which only gave me the chance to design and create a few pages (specifically the Get Involved page, picture beside, which does not show hover effects).

            This was were I self taught as much as I could on Python, but still did not understand a lot of it. I even remember not knowing loops were a thing until I learnt them in Junior College. However, I somehow knew lambda functions existed here. The more you know right.

            This app was made as I was flying flight simulators at that time, and there was a plugin called Chase Plane for a different flight simulator called Prepar3d. However, I was using X-Plane 11 at that time and there were no plugins that could do cinematic views. In fact, I don't think any exists as of writing this right now either. Imagine if I actually developed this and sold it.
            \n
            Anyways, with just three pages of UI, there were nearly 2000 lines of code and it was lagging whenever I tried editing it. Mostly, it came down to not knowing loops existed so I had to copy and paste code many times. I eventually gave up when I realised that X-Plane's plugins do not support Python and had to be coded in C if I correct. It did not however, stop my programming career surprisingly.`

The major one being visuals and it was nowhere close to any of the existing simulators. I purchased it when it came out and was surprised at how well it performed. However, the only lacking part is the physics department as X-Plane still handles it better even when X-Plane 12 got released in 2022. For me, it was more stable to run MSFS than X-Plane 11 and so I switched over. Besides, the visuals were too good to pass over.
            \n
            Although I did go back to X-Plane to fly the 787 a few times, I usually still fly on MSFS with the B777-300ER, A330-900, A320neo and B737-600 as it felt more realistic. Eventually I just settled into MSFS and used it as my main simulator. By the end of 2022, roughly 100 flights were done on MSFS, which although wasn't much in three years, most were done in 2020 and 2022 where I had more time out of National Service.

            `My time in SYFC went from it's high to it's low very quickly. I was considered one of, or if not the best student in the class (BFC 243). However, my time was cut short after the 8th flying lesson.
            \n
            At the start, during the theory part, we were tasked to remember the entire checklist from start to end. They had a grading from 1 - 7, where a 4 is required to pass, and getting a 4-5 was the norm. As for getting a 1 and 7, those basially never happen unless you were as smooth as someone who had thousands of flight hours or didn't know a single item on the checklist. Somehow or rather, I was the only one in the class who got a 6 for two different checklist test (one normal, one emergency). In addition, during my normal simulator and actual flying lessons, my average score was a 5. In fact, my instructor believed in my abilities so much so that he recommended me for the Private Pilot License (PPL) stage around the 3rd - 4th flying lesson, whereas the usual was at least 8 - 10 lessons. 
            \n
            To explain the system further, it's split into three parts: BFC1, BFC2 and PPL stage, where BFC1 is lesson 1 - 6, BFC2 is lessons 7 - 16 (where 16 is your first solo flight), and PPL is lesson 17 to around 52 where you get an actual PPL. 
            \n
            To get into BFC1, you need to pass their initial interview to join SYFC, and their medical checkup, which is Class 2 Aviation Medical Certificate. 
            \n
            BFC2 is usually a breeze for most to enter as long as you were an acceptable pilot. 
            \n
            PPL stage is only for the elite few, requiring you to be recommended by your instructor, and pass all additional Medical Requirements and COMPASS Test by the Air Force (it's the exact same requirement as joining the Air Force, which is stricter than Class 1 Aviation Medical Certificate). Out of a class of 30 or so in BFC1, usually only 1-3 pax will survive until the PPL stage. Many of whom aren't recommended, and some of which fail the medical requirements/COMPASS.
            \n
            As for myself, I failed the medical requirements for PPL course, and I since I did the tests early due to my instructor's recommendation, I was immediately withdrawn from SYFC right as my results came out and I didn't even get to fly my first solo. It was a heartbreaking moment but made me realised that although I didn't meet Air Force requirements, I still have a chance in the future to get a PPL, or even other licenses like ATPL if I can pass the Medical Assessmnt Class 1 and join airlines. It was also a fun time getting a total of 9.0 flight hours on the DA40 NG.`

I stayed there for about 50 controlling hours until I took a test for S2 as a Tower (TWR) controller. I managed to pass it the first time without much issues and I stayed at S2 for the rest of my time as a controller. Most of the time, I was controlling either Jakarta Airport or Bali Airport.
            \n
            As much as I wanted to continue to be a controller, most of the time the airports were empty without anyone there, with the only busy time during my S2 test and a World Flight event. As such, I just stopped coming online as a controller, but I still use VATSIM as a pilot from time to time. In total, I managed to be a controller for about 75 hours, giving me a great insight of controller life on whether I could do it as a job in real life.`

            As a young teenager, this was an expensive investment that paved my interest in aviation until the present. Previously, I was playing some random flight simulators on the web. Due to how unrealistic it was, I thought perhaps I should invest in an actual simulator. It was a good time for me to come into flight simulation as X-Plane 11 was just recently announced and the beta was released here. I bought it and was also given X-Plane 10 for free. I didn't really touch X-Plane 10 at all but X-Plane 11 was my main simulator until Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) came out in 2020. In fact, even by the end of 2022, around 80% of my lifetime flights was done in X-Plane 11.
            \n
            I started off with Mouse and Keyboard for flight sim, but eventually went for a Logitech Extreme 3D Joystick. After that, it was upgraded to a Thrustmaster T16000M, Logitech G Pro Throttle, and Thrustmaster TFRP. It stayed as such for many years to come as flight sim as a hobby and it's peripherals are generally very expensive.
            \n
            In X-Plane 11, most of my flights were of the B777-300ER, but there were quite a bit on the B737-800, A320-214, B787-9 and DA40 NG. Aside from the DA40 being used to practice at the time in Singapore Youth Flying Club, the other planes were used not only on my regular flights, but also to participate in events like Cross the Pond, and to make some YouTube videos with it, especially tutorials on how to fly or modify the aircraft to make it more realistic.

            `With my unique PC refresh around this period, I had a friend who wanted to build a PC as they wanted to upgrade from their old laptop. I took this chance to make use of my X570 and 5600X that had no issues and built a system around it for around $2000. At that time, prices are still hiked, especially for GPUs, but I managed to get an RX 6600 XT around MSRP for them. The PC was built with some looks in mind like sleeved cables so the performance wasn't as good as it could be. The build was as such:
            \n
            \nCase: Lian Li Lancool II Mesh
            \nPSU: EVGA 700 GD Gold

            `At the end of 2021, where I was also quite active in mining, CPU mining came into light as well for a bit. I thought that since I already have a Zen 3 series PC, I could upgrade my 5600X to a 5900X for CPU mining whilst gaining a bit of performance. TL;DR, it was not worth as the hype went up as fast as it went down, meaning it was actually better to stick with the 5600X. 
            \n
            At the same time, my want for a full white build started creeping in, and so I changed my motherboard as well to an Asus ROG Strix B550A, purely just for aesthetics. Not only that, I was still using my initial terrible Aftershock Ultracore case, so whilst changing my motherboard, I took the whole system out and made it caseless. It was one way to save money to not use a case, but also a very unique build that made use of the white cardboard that came with the previous used X570 motherboard. Some people hate it when I show it to them but I actually love it.`

As much of an issue I might be for the GPU market, I was not completely selfish as I did sell a handful of them to my friends at the price I bought it at so they can enjoy using it new GPUs without needing to suffer and search for it or pay ridiculous prices. 
            \n
            Beyond that, the other GPUs that I bought that felt worthy of mining were mostly turned into mining cards. Due to the increasing number of cards, I needed a third PC to support it. From there, I bought a used Ryzen 5 3600 and an Asus ROG Strix B350-F.
            \n
            At my peak of my mining career in 2022, I had 9 GPUs running, and tore down 3 GPUs to repaste and repad them for better temperatures.

Since I was kind of in a financial crisis, I thought it would be best if I used it for Cryptocurrency Mining. As such, I managed to scrape money from various places to get these two cards, as well as a cheap OEM PC to use it for mining Ethereum. As much as some people would hate me for doing it, I kinda hated myself as well but I needed to save money for my University fees and had no choice but to do so.
            \n
            I still however, learnt a lot of compatibility between parts and the different old versions of connectors like PCI and how it was incompatible with PCIe. The OEM PC had an i5-4590 with a Gigabyte B85M-D3V motherboard. It only supported DDR3 RAM, showing it's age. It was honestly not very worth to choose that as I didn't do my research as well but eventually worked out okay. It's main purpose served as my secondary mining PC as it only supported one GPU.

With my luck however, one day in March, I managed to find a 5600X at MSRP, so I decided to wing it and get a used motherboard as well to upgrade my build. It was an Asus Tuf X570 Plus. Compared to my i5-9600K, the improvement was welcomed after 3 years of technological improvement with it only costing me an additional ~$100 to upgrade. This was also a time for me to learn how to technically build the entire PC as most parts had to be disconnected and reconnected to the new motherboard.`

            `At the 3rd Quarter of 2020, when Nvidia launched the RTX 3000 series GPU, I was extremely shocked at the price to performance ratio. As such, I sold my 2080 Ti in hopes to get an RTX 3080 at the same price that I sold my 2080 Ti for, with a great jump in performance. It was a risky move as I wasn't guaranteed to get a GPU at all, and I didn't have a GPU for 4 months straight. However, it made me focus on my 'A' levels as well since I couldn't really play much games with my intergrated GPU.
            \n
            Incredibly in Jan 2021, I managed to find an RTX 3080 for about $1020, which was only $20 more than what I sold my 2080 Ti for. Without hesitation, I bought it, although it was the worst model as it was an MSI Ventus 3X OC. I say incredible because that was right before the US Tariff hikes on semiconductors that also raised the price of RTX 3000 series GPU across the board. In addition, I found it during an extremely high demand for RTX 3000 series GPU due to it's value where prices of a 3080 went up to over $2000. Not only that, although I manage to find it a few times before that, I didn't had the money to buy due to investments, and that this was actually the last time I manage to find the 3080 at all throughout the sky high prices that lasted until 2023. In fact, even after the RTX 4000 series cards got released, the prices of new RTX 3080 still hadn't drop to the price I bought this 3080 for.`

At that time, I changed my cooler as well with them to a Corsair H100i V2 from their own in house Aftershock cooler.

            Around the middle part of the year, I decided to add both a 1TB 970 Evo Plus and an MSI RTX 2080 Ti Sea Hawk X. The SSD choice was initially for games, but became by Windows drive. The GPU choice was because of Flight Simulation and that I felt the 1080 didn't have enough VRAM to support X-Plane 11 at a high setting. Both were relatively expensive for me as I paid for both, and installed it myself. This was my first time actually tinkering with PCs. During this time, I also changed my PSU to a 1000W Superflower Leadex Platinum SE to avoid power issues from the power hungry 2080 Ti and any future upgrades.`

            `Although it might seem quite fast to upgrade from a new Laptop the previous year, the requirements for games to play at a non-laggy level was increasing fast every year. Technically I never caught up to it before as laptop specs are usually way worse than desktop specs, even if it's the same model name. Besides, I just moved house at this point so I now had space to put a desktop, whereas previously there was zero space at all in the house for one. 
            \n
            I decided to go back to Aftershock again since at this point, I still didn't know how to build a PC by hand but I was comfortable with understanding the specs at this point. I went for the Aftershock Ultracore, which boasted a i7-7700K, GTX 1080, 16GB of DDR4 RAM. As I mentioned, it might seem like only one generation improvement from my laptop, but performance wise, it was a few generations as laptop specs are always slower due to their cooling and power restrictions.

            This was, however, a decision I didn't regret as technically it kept me going for many years later, though with many changes after this.
