            <p className="aboutMeTexts">
              My interest in programming came from the want to develop plugins
              for flight simulators. However, due to my limited knowledge at
              that time, I was not able to acomplish anything. What rekindled my
              interest in it was taking Computing in Junior College, which
              started the Butterfly Effect of my programming journey, got
              recommended as a{" "}
              <OrangeSpan text="Web Developer Intern in 2021," /> and got a{" "}
              <OrangeSpan text="secondary contract" /> a year after at{" "}
              <OrangeSpan text="Nam Hong Welfare Service Society (NHWSS)" />,
              and lead me to study Computer Science in NUS. That said, my main
              skills in programming is Website Building, with UI Design skills
              to complement that. In fact, this personal website is built by
              myself with React!
              <BreakLine count="2" />
              As for where my interest in designing came in, it all started from
              joining a Co Curriculum Activity (CCA) in Secondary School, where
              I joined Infocomm. I was taught mainly Photoshop and Illustrator
              skills there, along with a small amount of After Effects and
              Filming. As I was more interested in the designing aspect, I honed
              my skills there, alongside learning how to be a leader as the{" "}
              <OrangeSpan text="Vice-President of the CCA" /> in the later
              years. Although I did try to run for an ex-committe role in my CCA
              during my Junior College (JC) years, I was unfortunately not
              selected as they wanted to give others who haven't had a chance of
              being one before to be one. That however, gave me the free time to
              also join <OrangeSpan text="Singapore Youth Flying Club" /> to
              learn more about flying!
              <BreakLine count="2" />
              Beyond that, I'm also very interested in tech related stuff,
              especially PCs. I've built a few of them so far, including my own
              personal and favourite PC that is fully white themed! If you would
              like to see it, you can always head over to the Timeline page to
              explore :)

              Studies wise, I came from neighbourhood schools and worked my way
              up slowly over the years, eventually being able to join NUS in
              their Degree for Computer Science with just my academic results.
              Here's a history of where I'm studying/studied at:

              The reason for the break between 2020 and 2023 was due to National
              Service from 2021 to 2023. It was the time for me to build my
              portfolio on the side whilst serving my nation. Although I wasn't
              a commander, I was{" "}
              <OrangeSpan text="given commander roles as a men" />, taking up
              the tasks such as Company Orderly Sergeant (COS), and Duty
              Sergeant (DS) for a few months there, on top of my regular men
              duties.
              <BreakLine count="2" />
              That said, my highlight during my service was achieving the{" "}

              and Battery Sergeant Major (BSM), as well as achieving the
